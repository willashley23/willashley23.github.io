          <h3>Example of a good website: <a href = "http://www.chasejarvis.com/">Chase Jarvis</a> Professional Photographer</h5>   
          <p id = "comment">This website is very aesthetically pleasing, but that is something we will discuss more next week. Strictly speaking about HTML, I find his website to be very sophisticated. There is a lot I don't understand in his script. He has a !DOCTYPE html within another !DOCTYPE html, and they are connected by something called "iframe". If I had to guess, I would say it has some sort of function similar to a div wrapper, but with more specifications. It helps keep the website organized.</p>
