  <h1>Photography</h1>
      <p>One of my favorite hobbies is photography. I have been taking landscape photos since 2014, though I haven't taken any classes (but I would like to!)</p>
         <h2>Here are some examples of my work:</h2>
         <img src = "memorialbest1.jpg"></img>
            <p><em>Chaing Kai-Shek Memorial, Taipei, Taiwan, (2014).</em></p>
         <img src = "Galaxy2-1 copy.jpg"></img>
            <p><em>The Milky Way As Seen From Lawrence, Kansas, (2015).</em></p>

          <h5>Example of a good website:<a href = "http://www.chasejarvis.com/">Chase Jarvis</a> Professional Photographer</h5>   
          <p>This website is very aesthetically pleasing, but that is something we will discuss more next week. Strictly speaking about HTML, I find his website to be very sophisticated. There is a lot I don't understand in his script. He has a !DOCTYPE html within another !DOCTYPE html, and they are connected by something called "iframe". If I had to guess, I would say it has some sort of function similar to a div wrapper, but with more specifications. It helps keep the website organized.</p>
